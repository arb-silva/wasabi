# Wasabi at silva
**SILVA branded fork of the original wasabi**
This fork of wasabi provides changes made to the wasabi instance in use by the SILVA team.

**Web-based environment for evolutionary sequence analysis and data visualisation.**  
Wasabi visualises sequence data together with a phylogenetic tree within a modern, user-friendly interface.  
It automatically stores intermediate analysis steps with data sharing links and is extendable with plugins.
